Installation
To run the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
Obtain an API token from Hugging Face to use the text summarization model.
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/karannchaudhari04/AI-Text-Summerizer.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd AI-Text-Summarizer
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up your Hugging Face API Token:

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your API token:

makefile
Copy code
ACCESS_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token
Start the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start

The backend uses a POST request to the Hugging Face API for text summarization. The API expects a JSON payload with the text to summarize and returns the summarized text.

POST /summarize
Request:

text_to_summarize (string): The text to be summarized.
Response:

summary_text (string): The summarized version of the input text.
Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "text_to_summarize": "Your lengthy text here"
}
